# Arcade-Tennis-Game-JS

This is a simple arcade game created for fun and practice.

The goal was to learn the basis of JavaScript programming and important concepts seen in almost every game such as how to handle collisions.
For more information about the game and how to run it see the wiki page [Arcade Tennis Game JS](https://github.com/fulalsayab/Arcade-Tennis-Game-JS/wiki/Arcade-Tennis-Game-JS)
